Make the project portable - Windows / Linux / macOS, x86 and ARM.
First step would be deciding on a build system - is there anything less ugly
than CMake?

Clean up and modernize the codebase. Target C++20, since that should be readily
available by now.

See if there's more optimizations to be done for the bruteforcing code. Profile!

Use instruction-set support for SHA-256. I haven't looked at what's available
for ARM (probably at least some SIMD stuff), but Intel SHA extensions / SHA-NI
has been available since ~2017. Also, specialize the implementation; we're not
even doing one full block, so there's bound to be a lot of stuff that can be
cut away or unrolled.

Rust implementation of multibrute. Would be a fun project, interesting to see
what the performance profile is like, and could be expanded to run in a web
browser.

Possibly do a GPU implementation? I have no GPU programming experience, so I
have no idea whether it's viable to do both number-generation and hashing in
shader code, or if only the hashing can be offloaded (which might not be all
that much faster, then, because of generation, copying memory back and forth
etc), but it has the potential to be very fast since the brute-forcing is an
embarassingly parallel task. Probably requires a bunch of dependendencies
that complicates portability etc.
